# Getting Started

Clone the repository and make sure that all the dependencies are downloaded.

```
yarn install
```

### Run the tests!

This is a testing workshop after all!

```
yarn jest
``` 

### Start up the dev server.

Make sure everything compiles as expected, and you should see our program running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:300) (unless of course something else is occupying that port). 

```
yarn start
```
